    <p> Inspired by Pate De Fruit.</p>
    <p> From Genshin Wiki: "Lyney's specialty. 
        He covered the fruit you picked with velvet and then uncovered it â€” voila! 
        You were greeted by a colorful assortment of gummies. 
        You sampled one and your mood immediately changed. 
        Did the great magician cast some incredible enchantment spell to bewitch the heart while no one was watching?"</p>
